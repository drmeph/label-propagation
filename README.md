# Label Propagation
This project was created to play with [Semi Supervised Learning with Label Propagation](https://machinelearningmastery.com/semi-supervised-learning-with-label-propagation/)

The algorithm was proposed in the 2002 technical report by Xiaojin Zhu and Zoubin Ghahramani titled [Learning From Labeled And Unlabeled Data With Label Propagation](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/pub/CMU-CALD-02-107.pdf)
